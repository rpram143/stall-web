## SQL seed for demo / presentation

If you need to show the project with a backing database to an invigilator, there's a ready SQL seed at `sql/seed.sql` that creates simple tables and inserts sample data (products, a demo user, and a cart item).

Quick ways to load it:

- SQLite (recommended for local demo):

```bash
# create demo.db and load schema + data
sqlite3 demo.db < sql/seed.sql

# open the DB to inspect
sqlite3 demo.db
```

- Postgres:

```bash
# create database and load
createdb demo_db
psql -d demo_db -f sql/seed.sql
```

Notes:
- The `users.password` field in the seed is a placeholder (`<PASSWORD_HASH_OR_PLAINTEXT>`). For realistic demo you can replace it with a SHA-256 hash generated by the app (or use a plaintext value only for offline demos).
- Do not use plaintext passwords in production. This SQL is for demonstration and grading only.

Demo credentials included
------------------------

The seed now includes a demo user so you can log into the app during a presentation:

- Email: demo@example.com
- Password: demo123

The password is stored as a SHA-256 hash in the seed (`users.password`). You can use the above plaintext password to log in via the web UI â€” the app hashes the entered password with SHA-256 and matches it against the stored hash.

Running the demo server (Express + SQLite)
----------------------------------------

The project includes a small Express server that uses the `demo.db` SQLite file. The frontend will call this server for register/login/products/cart/orders when it's running.

1. Install server deps (from project root):

```cmd
cd server
npm install
```

2. Start the server:

```cmd
npm run start --prefix server
```

The server will listen on http://localhost:4000 and expose endpoints under `/api`.

3. Start the frontend (in a separate terminal):

```cmd
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the site in your browser. Use the demo credentials (demo@example.com / demo123) to log in, or register a new user which will be stored in `demo.db` when the server is running.

Sharing Your Project as ZIP
-----------------------------

**YES, you can share your project as a ZIP file!** The database will work perfectly.

1. **Compress the project folder** into a ZIP file (all files except `node_modules`)
2. **Share the ZIP** with your friends
3. **When they extract and open it:**
   - They can directly open `index.html` in a web browser
   - The app automatically uses **localStorage** (browser storage) if the server isn't running
   - All features work: login, products, cart, orders - everything!
   - Each user's data is stored in their own browser

**Note:** The server (`server/` folder) is optional. The app works perfectly without it using browser localStorage. The server is only needed if you want a shared database across multiple users on the same network.
